    <h2> Description </h2>
    <p> These spicy <em>chicken wraps</em> have a creamy sauce made with mayo, honey, and cucumber to create an easy summer meal that will rock your taste buds! </p>
    <h3> <strong> <ul> Ingredients </ul></strong></h3>
    <li> 2 tablespoons olive oil </li>
    <li> 1 ½ pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into thin strips </li>
    <li> 1 cup thick and chunky salsa </li>
    <li> 1 tablespoon honey </li>
    <li> ½ teaspoon cayenne pepper </li>
    <li> 8 (10 inch) flour tortillas </li>
    <li> 1 (10 ounce) bag baby spinach leaves </li>
    <h3> <em> <ol> Steps </ol></em></h3>
    <li> Make the sauce: Mix mayonnaise, cucumber, honey, cayenne pepper, and black pepper together in a bowl until smooth. Cover and refrigerate until needed.</li>
    <li> Make the wraps: Heat olive oil in a skillet on medium-high heat. Add chicken strips; cook and stir until they start to turn golden and are no longer pink in the middle, about 8 minutes. Stir in salsa, honey, and cayenne pepper. Reduce the heat to medium-low; simmer, stirring occasionally, until flavors have blended, about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li> Stack tortillas, 4 at a time, in a microwave oven and heat until warm and pliable, 20 to 30 seconds per batch.</li>
    <li> Spread each tortilla with 1 tablespoon mayonnaise-cucumber sauce, top with a layer of spinach, and arrange about 1/2 cup of the chicken mixture on top. </li>
    <li> Fold the bottom of each tortilla up about 2 inches, and start rolling from the right side. When wrap is halfway rolled, fold the top of the tortilla down, enclosing the filling, and continue rolling to make a tight, compact cylinder.</li>
